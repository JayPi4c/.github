# Welcome!

This page contains a collection of my more or less maintened projects. It's mostly for me to have a collection of all my projects in one place, but you are welcome to look around. 

## About me

I'm a computer science student at University of Oldenburg, Germany. <br>
I'm most experienced in Java, but I also have some projects in C, C++, Python, JavaScript and PHP. Also I experiment with other tools like Docker from time to time.<br>
Find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@JayPi4c) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JayPi4c).<br>
