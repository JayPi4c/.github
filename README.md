# Welcome!

This page contains a collection of my more or less maintened projects.👷 It's mostly for me to have an overview of all my projects in one place, but you are welcome to look around.🔭

## About me

I'm a computer science student at University of Oldenburg, Germany. 🧑‍🎓 <br>
I'm most experienced in Java, but I also have some projects in C, C++, Python, JavaScript and PHP. Also I experiment with other tools like Docker from time to time. 👨‍💻<br>
